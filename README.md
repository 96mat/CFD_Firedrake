All the scripts can be used directly on Google-Colab without installing locally ```Firedrake```. Here some numerical experiments are done solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations
eventually coupling them with other physics.
1. Incompressible Navier-Stokes equation
2. Temperature equation
3. Concentration equation
4. Multiphase Level-Set coupling i.e. Navier-Stokes + Level Set transport equation + Temperature equation
